# Important Project Requirements

**Stream API:**

You must make use of the Java Stream API wherever it is applicable, especially for collection processing, filtering, mapping, aggregation, and other data operations. Clearly highlight these usages in your code and documentation.

**Unit Testing:**

Implement unit tests for your business logic using JUnit or a similar testing framework. Include instructions for running your test suite and ensure your tests cover major functionalities and edge cases.

**Singleton Pattern:**

Where a class should have only one instance (for example, for managing resources, database connections, configuration, etc.), apply the Singleton design pattern.

## 1. Problem Description

Managing personal finances can be difficult without a proper system. Many people lose track of their expenses, leading to poor budgeting and financial stress. This project solves that problem by providing a simple finance tracker where users can record, view, and categorize their transactions. It helps users become more aware of their spending and build better money habits.

---

## 2. User Stories

Describe the system from the user's perspective using user stories:

* As a user, I want to register an account so that I can securely access my personal dashboard.

* As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can manage my financial records.

* As a user, I want to add income and expense transactions so that I can track my spending.

* As a user, I want to view my past transactions so that I can review and analyze my expenses.

* As a user, I want to categorize my transactions so that I can organize my financial data.

* As a user, I want to select a specific month and year so that I can filter my transaction data.

* As a user, I want to log out when I‚Äôm done so that my data remains secure.
* ...

## 5. Architecture of Project

The Finance Tracker follows a modular **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture:

### üß± 1. Model
- Contains plain Java classes (POJOs) representing core entities like `User`, `Transaction`, and `Category`.
- Handles data structures used throughout the app.

### üñ• 2. View (UI Layer)
- Built using Java Swing.
- Panels such as `LoginPanel`, `DashboardPanel`, `AddTransactionPanel`, etc., are responsible for rendering the user interface.
- UI components interact with the controller via listeners and callbacks.

### üß† 3. Controller / Logic
- Business logic and interaction control are handled inside panel classes or passed as lambdas (e.g., onLoginSuccess).
- Handles user actions, input validation, and triggers data updates.

### üóÑ 4. Data Access Layer (DAO)
- Interfaces with a relational database using JDBC.
- Classes like `UserDAO`, `TransactionDAO`, and `CategoryDAO` abstract raw SQL operations.
- Ensures separation of database logic from UI code.

### üß© 5. Database
- A MySQL (or similar) database holds all persistent data: users, transactions, and categories.
- Accessed securely via the DAO layer.

### üîÑ Navigation and Flow
- Uses `CardLayout` to manage screen transitions between login, dashboard, and other panels.
- The `MainFrame` acts as the root controller and navigator of the entire app.


### 5.1 Overview

The Finance Tracker system follows a layered architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. The major layers are:

#### 1. Presentation Layer (UI)
- Built with Java Swing.
- Handles all user interactions, input forms, buttons, and display panels.
- Uses `CardLayout` to switch between views (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Add Transaction).

#### 2. Application Logic Layer (Controller)
- Manages interaction between the UI and the data layer.
- Handles business rules such as login validation, transaction creation, and category management.
- Often implemented using listeners, callbacks, and panel methods.

#### 3. Data Access Layer (DAO)
- Provides CRUD operations for accessing and modifying database records.
- Contains DAO classes like `UserDAO`, `TransactionDAO`, and `CategoryDAO`.
- Encapsulates all database logic using JDBC.

#### 4. Database Layer
- A relational database stores persistent data such as users, transactions, and categories.
- Tables are mapped to Java classes (models) and accessed via the DAO layer.
- Ensures data consistency, integrity, and long-term storage.

Each layer communicates only with adjacent layers, allowing the system to remain modular, testable, and easier to maintain or extend.

* **Data Access Layer:**  
  Uses DAO (Data Access Object) classes to perform database operations on users, transactions, and categories. This layer abstracts database queries and ensures secure, efficient CRUD operations.

* **Database:**  
  A relational database stores all persistent data such as user credentials, financial transaction records, and category information, enabling reliable data storage and retrieval across sessions.

## 13. Design Justification & Principles

- **Use of Interfaces and Composition:**  
  The project uses DAO interfaces (e.g., `UserDAO`, `CategoryDAO`, `TransactionDAO`) to separate data access logic from UI and business logic. This allows easy replacement of data sources or mocking during testing. Composition is applied in UI panels by injecting DAO dependencies and callbacks, promoting loose coupling and better maintainability.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  UI components like `DashboardPanel`, `AddTransactionPanel`, `ViewTransactionPanel`, and `ManageCategoryPanel` follow consistent interfaces and behavior, allowing them to be swapped or extended without breaking the main frame‚Äôs navigation or flow. This design ensures that subclasses or panel replacements maintain expected behaviors.

- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  The application design supports adding new features without modifying existing code. For example, new transaction types or UI panels can be added by extending existing classes and registering them in the card layout, without changing the core navigation or data models. The use of functional interfaces for callbacks (e.g., refreshing dashboard after adding transactions) also adheres to OCP by allowing extension through composition.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - **DAO Pattern:** Abstracts all database operations through interfaces and concrete implementations (`UserDAO`, `CategoryDAO`, `TransactionDAO`), enabling clean separation of concerns and easy database swapping or mocking.
  - **Observer Pattern / Callback Functions:** Panels notify others about data changes using callbacks (e.g., `AddTransactionPanel` triggers a dashboard refresh), enabling responsive UI updates without tight coupling.
  - **CardLayout for View Management:** Manages switching between multiple UI screens (login, dashboard, add transaction, etc.) cleanly, maintaining separation of concerns and simplifying navigation logic.

These design choices enhance modularity, ease of testing, and future extensibility, making the Finance Tracker robust and adaptable.
